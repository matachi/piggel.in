have been acquired by the company LogMeIn. Apparently their <a class="reference external" href="https://investor.logmeininc.com/about-us/investors/news/press-release-details/2015/LogMeIn-to-Acquire-Password-Management-Leader-LastPass/default.aspx">long-term goal</a>
is to merge LastPass with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meldium.com/">Meldium</a> which they
acquired last year:</p>
<blockquote>
Following the close of the deal, LogMeIn plans to bring complementary
capabilities of its early identity management investments, including those
of Meldium, which it acquired in September 2014, into LastPass.  In the
near-term, both the Meldium and LastPass product lines will continue to be
supported, with longer-term plans to center around a singular identity
management offering based on the LastPass service and brand.</blockquote>
<p>People on <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10359491">Hacker News</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3o3c74/logmein_to_acquire_lastpass/">Reddit</a>
are overall very upset and many are now looking for alternatives to LastPass.
One user made a nice <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3o3c74/logmein_to_acquire_lastpass/cvtrzha">post</a>
with a list of 15 alternative services.</p>
<p>I very much liked LastPass and I have been a premium customer for about 5
years.  LastPass felt like a serious, small company with one single focus which
you could trust. I have no experience with LogMeIn, but people in the above
mentioned comments fields seem to be afraid about the direction they might
steer LastPass in. I think LastPass is more or less feature complete and I
don't like that they will merge it with Meldium. Meldium gives me a bad
feeling.</p>
<p>Two self-managed alternatives I have been looking at are <a class="reference external" href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.passwordstore.org/">Pass</a>. Both are
open source and support Linux, Firefox and Android. However, where KeePass is a
Windows application which has been ported to Linux with the help of Mono, Pass
is a more &quot;true&quot; Linux application. I like that Pass is primarily a terminal
application which utilizes GPG for encryption and Git for syncing.</p>
<p>I installed KeePass and the Firefox add-on <a class="reference external" href="http://keefox.org/">KeeFox</a>,
since KeePass seems to be highly popular. However, I think KeePass feels like a
quite bloated and heavy setup, and its GUI radiates a Windows aura which
disgusts me.</p>
<img alt="Screenshot of KeePass" class="img-responsive center-block" src="http://piggel.in/images/keepass.jpg" />
<p>My next step is to give Pass and its Firefox add-on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jvenant/passff">passff</a> a shot.</p>
